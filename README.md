Titanic Survival Prediction | End-to-End Machine Learning Project
This project predicts whether a passenger survived in the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques.
It covers the complete end-to-end ML workflow â€” from data exploration to model deployment.

Project Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts survival probabilities of passengers aboard the Titanic, based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc.

This project follows a complete ML lifecycle, including:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training and Evaluation
5. Building a Reusable Pipeline
6. Deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Key Features:
1. End-to-end ML workflow (from raw data to deployment)
2. Automated data preprocessing pipeline
3. Logging and exception handling
4. Modular code structure (reusable components and utilities)
5. Flask-based web application for predictions
6. AWS Beanstalk deployment setup
